The job that I love is also the same as the job that I have been working for more than five years. I'm a software engineer, and I  work for a company called Transcosmos Technologic Arts, a Japanese software company.


Software engineering has been ranked as the hottest job in the world. Basically; software engineer is responsible for creating quality software products, amazing websites as well as mobile apps or games that meet customer’s requirements. If you are a software engineer working for a big software company like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. you will be working with other software engineers and be separated and specialized in testing, programming, developing, quality assurance, architecture, and of course project management if you like, or you're capable of. If you are a software engineer working in a manufacturing or business company, you could be working on Customer Relationship Management system (CRM); Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP)..etc.


What I really love about my job is that I was able to meet loads of different, interesting people every day. And I also gain lots of experiences from professionals who can give me advice or guide me how to become an expert in the software industry. In addition, this job is also giving me a change to learn more and improve myself day by day. It is not only the hard skills related to my specialty like coding, fixing bugs, searching some new technologies, dealing with problems..etc.but also all the soft skills that a software engineer should have like communication skill, presentation skill, decision making, leadership and the most important is teamwork.


Becoming a software engineer was the best thing I’ve done, and I've never regretted. And if I have to choose again, I still choose it.
